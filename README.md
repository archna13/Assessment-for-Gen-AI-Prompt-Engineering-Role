Gen AI Prompt Engineering Assessment
This repository contains solutions to the Gen AI/Prompt Engineering assessment for various problem statements involving Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Generation, Prompt Engineering, Data Analysis, and API Integration using Python.

Problem Statements
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The task is to preprocess and tokenize text data using Python libraries such as NLTK or spaCy. The implementation should handle edge cases like punctuation, stop words, and different cases.

Solution: preprocess_text.py
Libraries used: NLTK, string

2. Text Generation
The goal is to implement a text generation model using a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., GPT-3) via the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model generates coherent text based on a given prompt.

Solution: text_generation.py
Libraries used: Transformers, Hugging Face

3. Prompt Engineering
This problem focuses on designing and evaluating prompts to improve an AI model’s performance on a specific task like summarization or question answering. Different prompt designs are experimented with, and their effectiveness is evaluated.

Solution: prompt_engineering.py
Libraries used: Hugging Face Transformers

4. Data Analysis
The task requires analyzing a dataset and generating insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Solution: data_analysis.ipynb
Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

5. API Integration
A Python script is developed to integrate with an external API and fetch data based on user input. It handles different types of API responses and errors gracefully.

Solution: api_integration.py
Libraries used: Requests
